# gRPC vs REST - A Comparison with Book Details API

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates a comparison between two popular communication protocols, gRPC and REST, using a simple Book Details API. The aim is to help you understand the strengths and trade-offs of each approach in a real-world scenario.

### Background

- **gRPC**: gRPC is a high-performance, language-agnostic RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework developed by Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport and Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for serialization.

- **REST**: Representational State Transfer is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication and typically exchanges data in JSON or XML format.

## The Scenario

Imagine you are building an application that needs to fetch details of books from a remote server. To illustrate the differences between gRPC and REST, we have implemented two versions of the Book Details API:

1. **gRPC API**: This version of the API uses gRPC to fetch book details.

2. **REST API**: This version of the API uses traditional RESTful principles and HTTP methods (specifically, the GET method) to fetch book details.

## Getting Started

To explore the comparison between gRPC and REST in action, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
